      <description>Java 5 was one of those versions that brought much more features and syntactic sugars than any other of them. Varargs is one of those. This provides a very comfortable way to pass different number of arguments to a method. Can we use it anywhere?
Varargs is just a syntactic sugar, it can be used in a more flexible way than its predecessor, the typed array. It has the same characteristics which means it supports indexing, it has an attribute called length, it is iterable.</description>
