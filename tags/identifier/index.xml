      <description>Some special characters are accepted as part of an identifier, dollar sign is among them.
Have you ever though about to write an application, whichever small that would be, and use as less identifier as possible.
And what if the identifier is weird itself already?
class $ { private String $; public void $(String $) { this.$ = $; } public String $() { return this.$; } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { $ $ = new $(); $.</description>

      <title>Do you know Java: Underscore as identifier</title>

      <description>We could use underscore as a variable name until Java 7, but it cannot be used as an identifier from Java 9 and upwards.
Java has strict rules about how to name a variable, which characters are accepted in it or which one can be the first one. Underscore is a legal character among alphabetic characters and numbers. What if I did not use any other chars just underscore? Is that still valid variable name?</description>
