      <description>Application terminates when all threads are terminated. But what if some of them run endlessly?
Sometimes threads run until a condition is met, sometimes they run endlessly.
Once a thread is created and then started, it runs parallel with the main execution. Our app terminates when all threads are terminated including our main method as well.
What if a thread is infinite and still running though the main is already terminated?</description>
