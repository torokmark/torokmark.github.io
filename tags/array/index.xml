      <description>Python provides three basic datastructures, dictionary, list, and tuple. If we need another datastruct which is different from the mentioned three, we have to implement ourones.
As I started using python in my daily work, more and more questions had cropped up about the language and its refinement. One of them was to implement a custom array.
What we would like to achieve is to have a datastruct which behaves like an array.</description>
