      <description>Routing mechanism is one of the main parts of a web service. Here I provide one approach to achieve this. This implementation is based on n-ary tree and tree search.
Many ways are available to handle routes, from regex to n-ary trees to parse registered route one by one.

All implementations are found in this repo: https://github.com/torokmark/builders_in_python
The Simple One Task: Let us implement a Person with the following fields like name, age, phone.</description>
