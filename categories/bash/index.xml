      <description>Shell script does not support container types like map, set, or queue, though with a third-party lib, presented here, we can use them in our scripts.
From time to time we need map, queue or any other kind of collections during our work. Shell script is definitely not the right choice to write applications but it may happen that we need some of the previously mentioned types to help our work.</description>

      <description>A little lib that helps us checking our scripts with a unit test-like way.
The Missing Tool Unit testing is part of a lot of projects&amp;rsquo; toolset. Though some part of the source code requires more attention than it gets payed. Shell scripts belong to them.
How can we make sure that our scripts do what we expect they do?
How can we make sure they are valid, return the right result&amp;hellip;?</description>
