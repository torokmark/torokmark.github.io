      <description>Ruby provides a very flexible way to create new types with certain fields with Struct. Though Python does not have this functionality naturally, with esu package we can do the same.
Ruby types have rich API which is brought by the design, and the language features as well. Even though Python is very dynamic and flexible as well, some of the features are lacking in the languages.
In this post I would like to show you a Python package, name is esu, which brings a struct that can provide almost the same functionality.</description>
