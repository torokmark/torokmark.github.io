      <description>You do not need comments to decorate your code minimally.
Many years back then comments were the ultimate tool to decorate our code. And as it happened many times, sotware engineers glady used it to place ascii arts around their hotfixes or just simple seperate their solutions.
In this post I would like to show you a funny feature of operators which you can use to draw lines or more.</description>

      <description>Sadly, one of our colleagues hasn&amp;rsquo;t used version control system and the flash drive he has used was broken, so we have lost one part of the source code such as Starter class.
class App extends Starter { @Override public void start() { System.out.println(&amp;#34;Start&amp;#34;); } public static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); } } Implement the Starter class and make it work! Once you start the application it should call the start method of App class.</description>

The series is about learning the language, learning its features, functionalities, and limits. It is up to you how to do it!
I am going to post a code snippet with a hidden misfunctionality. Your challenge is to solve that keeping the rules and limitations that I attach to the snippet.</description>

      <description>One of the most important methods is equals. So, it is also important how it is implemented.
What is the real issue with instanceof and equals? Let us see an implementation of it. First, let us introduce a simple class and its inheritant that demonstrate the usage of equals`.
public class Mug { private double capacity; // ctor, setter, getter @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (this == o) { return true; } if (o == null) { return false; } if (!</description>

      <description>Java has a lot of keywords which are not used as identifiers or values.
Though, Java has a lot of keywords, some of them are less known or even not used. More over not used because they cannot be used at all.
The good old goto is one of the two. Since sequence, selection and iteration are enough for Turing machine, goto became unnecessarily, not to mention that understanding the code becomes hard to follow.</description>

      <description>Java 15 introduces record type.
Records are a new kind of class in the Java language. The purpose of a record is to declare that a small group of variables is to be regarded as a new kind of entity. As said in JEP 384.
Simple data carrier classes contain too much boilerplate code compared to the data itself. Fields, getter, setters, ctors, toString, equals, hashCode. On the other hand, quite difficult to figure out what the class represents.</description>

      <guid>https://torokmark.github.io/posts/do-you-know-java-instanceof-pattern-matching/</guid>
      <description>Java 15 brings a syntactic sugar, called Pattern Matching for instanceof, with which we can shorten the code and make it more safe.
In prior versions of Java, the instanceof operator workes as follows:
Object o = &amp;#34;asdf&amp;#34;; if (o instanceof String) { String s = (String) o; System.out.println(o); } Java 15 - and Java 14 as a preview feature - introduces an enhanced instanceof operator, which brings the ability to cast the eximined instance to the type of the right operand.</description>

      <guid>https://torokmark.github.io/posts/do-you-know-java-immutable-object/</guid>
      <description>Couple of thoughts about how to implement immutable objects.
Class has to be final. Fields have to be private and final. Hence, fields are set in constructor. No setters and setter-like methods. If object is passed in ctor parameter, make a clone of it. Do the same in getters as well. public final class Person { private final String name; private final int age; private final List&amp;lt;PhoneNumber&amp;gt; phoneNumbers; public Person(String name, int age, List&amp;lt;PhoneNumber&amp;gt; phoneNumbers) { this.</description>

      <description>Java 14 has brought a helpful feature with that we can get information about the source of the raised NullPointerException
NullPointerException is not very friendly and can occur anywhere. All the placed where we don&amp;rsquo;t want it to be. In this post I will show you how to track down its source.
The following source code is given:
String value = null; System.out.println(value.length()); Pre Java 14 Era The good old error message is the following:</description>

      <description>Text blocks is a new proposed feature, hopefully coming with Java 15.
Until then, let us see how it looks like in Java 14 as a feature preview.
Here is how we declare a multiline string value. Once we have to concatenate, and also have to place new line characters (\n).
String text = &amp;#34;one line\n&amp;#34; + &amp;#34;and\n&amp;#34; + &amp;#34;another&amp;#34;; When text is printed out:

      <description>Some special characters are accepted as part of an identifier, dollar sign is among them.
Have you ever though about to write an application, whichever small that would be, and use as less identifier as possible.
And what if the identifier is weird itself already?

      <description>Enums are easy and straigthforward at first sight, but this type has some hidden sides.
public enum Day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY } For enumeration type, Java has a keyword called enum. That was introduced in Java 1.5. All enum types are implicitly inhereted from Enum class. Hence, all enum types has all methods that Enum has, like name, ordinal, etc. We cannot extend an enum, and enum does not extend custom types.</description>

ProcessBuilder ProcessBuilder class has been created to create and handle operating system processes.
ProcessBuilder#start method creates a single native process. Let us see how to do it.

      <description>Application terminates when all threads are terminated. But what if some of them run endlessly?
Sometimes threads run until a condition is met, sometimes they run endlessly.
Once a thread is created and then started, it runs parallel with the main execution. Our app terminates when all threads are terminated including our main method as well.
What if a thread is infinite and still running though the main is already terminated?</description>

      <guid>https://torokmark.github.io/posts/do-you-know-java-try-with-resource/</guid>
      <description>Try-with-resource gives a safer way to handle exceptions and resources.
A quite big drawback of try-catch-finally that we have to close resource at the end, otherwise the resource remains locked - not always, but sometimes!
So either we try not to forget to close the resouce, and place finally at the end, or apply something that does this job instead of us.
Try-Catch-Finally The hard part comes in finally, which encloses a try-catch, and null check is very easy to forget.</description>

      <description>Catching multiple exceptions is very useful when we are intended to do the same operations when they are raised.
The feature introduced in Java 7 and by using it we can place exceptions in the same catch branch.
The old way looked like as follows.
try { } catch (SQLException ex) { logger.log(ex); } catch (RemoteException ex) { logger.log(ex); } catch (NullPointerException ex) { logger.log(ex); } In Java 7 and onwards, we can place multiple exceptions in one catch branch.</description>

Object void add(List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt; list) { list.add(&amp;#34;string&amp;#34;); list.add(1); } Passing the followings are:
add(new ArrayList&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;()); // not type safe add(new ArrayList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;()); // compile time error The first is not type safe, the second one does not compile, since ArrayList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; is not the subtype of List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;.</description>

What if we are intended to validate the parameters of a function? What if we liked to set up preconditions? How can we avoid working with null objects?
In this post we take a look at two approaches. At first, we see how we can check parameters with assertion and what its pros and cons are.</description>

      <description>We could use underscore as a variable name until Java 7, but it cannot be used as an identifier from Java 9 and upwards.
Java has strict rules about how to name a variable, which characters are accepted in it or which one can be the first one. Underscore is a legal character among alphabetic characters and numbers. What if I did not use any other chars just underscore? Is that still valid variable name?</description>

      <description>Ruby provides a very handy type called OpenStruct to create objects. It brings the opportunity to add fields to objects during the runtime. Here is its Python counterpart.
In the previous post I showed Struct from esu which helps creating new types with fields and methods. That has a sibling, called OpenStruct which helps creating objects on the fly.
Usage Ruby&amp;rsquo;s OpenStruct (doc:2.6.5) inspired it, and it looks as follows.</description>

      <description>Ruby provides a very flexible way to create new types with certain fields with Struct. Though Python does not have this functionality naturally, with esu package we can do the same.
Ruby types have rich API which is brought by the design, and the language features as well. Even though Python is very dynamic and flexible as well, some of the features are lacking in the languages.
In this post I would like to show you a Python package, name is esu, which brings a struct that can provide almost the same functionality.</description>

      <description>Java 5 was one of those versions that brought much more features and syntactic sugars than any other of them. Varargs is one of those. This provides a very comfortable way to pass different number of arguments to a method. Can we use it anywhere?
Varargs is just a syntactic sugar, it can be used in a more flexible way than its predecessor, the typed array. It has the same characteristics which means it supports indexing, it has an attribute called length, it is iterable.</description>

      <description>Underscore can be used in numeric literals to group digits in a numeric value. This way that can enhance code readability, decrease mistyping and helps visually keeping numeric values in range.
Code readability is one of the most important viewpoints of software development. The more readable the code is, the faster that can be understood by developers.
Java 7 introduced underscore as a comfortable way to separate digits of a numeric value into groups.</description>

      <description>Java 11 introduced a new way of executing applications. That gives us the opportunity to do it without excplicitely compiling it. What&amp;rsquo;s more, Java code can be run as a script.
In Java, compilation and execution of an app are two different steps. The java command gives us the feeling that we work with an interpreter.
The Pre-Java-11 era Compilation of the source code and execution of the app are separated commands before Java 11, as we see here:</description>

      <description>Operators have precedence and sometimes they can give us hard time to figure out why our code works as it does.
Ruby has three or operators, |, ||, and the readable or. All of them have different precedences. That is, the precedence, that makes some trouble if we do not care about which one we use.
The evaluation of logical operators are left-associative, that means the far left operator is evaluated at first, than its result will be the left operand of the next operator and so on.</description>

      <description>Shell script does not support container types like map, set, or queue, though with a third-party lib, presented here, we can use them in our scripts.
From time to time we need map, queue or any other kind of collections during our work. Shell script is definitely not the right choice to write applications but it may happen that we need some of the previously mentioned types to help our work.</description>

      <description>All Java applications start with a class and an entry point in it. We can change the class type to others.
All Java applications start at one common point. That is a class which has at least one static method, called main as an entry point of the app. This method is called by JRE after the class is loaded when we execute java command with the appropriate name of the class.</description>

      <guid>https://torokmark.github.io/posts/safe-navigation-in-languages/</guid>
      <description>As we saw in the previous post, Ruby development team introduced a safe navigation operator to get rid of painful chaining of objects, which could raise NPE in case of null object in the middle. But Ruby is not the only language that came up with this idea. Most of the languages have introduced this operator, usually called null propagation, or some other approaches to achieve the same goal.
In this post I write some snippets to demonstrate what other languages provide to prevent the exception raised by referencing to a null object.</description>

      <description>Flexibility of Ruby brings many ways to achieve the same results, whether it is a loop, selection of elements from datastructures, or assignment of values.
Performance is one of the major metrics of an application. Ruby provides a module, natively brought by the language, called Benchmark, which helps us to observe the code and reflects the potential bottlenecks.
Sometimes that is very suprising which statement executes faster and which of them provides less performance.</description>

      <description>Double brace initialization is a very comfortable way to add values to a collection or pairs to a map instance instead of having multiple statements next to each other.
One of the most popular languages, though Java is full of interesting parts that look wierd or unusual at first glance. In the sequence I call Do you know Java, I would like to present these less known or unexplained parts of the languages.</description>

      <description>Navigation through embedded objects can suprise us with an error if one of the fields, which are objects as well, is null. We are in the same situation if we have a hash object and want to get a value by key if key does not exist. The burning situation crops up if we chain up methods next to each other.
In this post I write some approaches, how to keep our code still clean, readable and safe if we liked to chain up calls next one another on an object or on a key-value pair container.</description>

      <description>Writing code in a clean way differs in every language. Python also has its own style. Additionally, python is famous about its one-liners.
Pythonic way is an approach of how to use the language and how to take adventage of its syntax and semantic. Python can give a very elegant way of one-liners to achieve something that most of the languages can do, but not as short and still readable way as python does it.</description>

How can we make sure that our scripts do what we expect they do?
How can we make sure they are valid, return the right result&amp;hellip;?</description>

      <description>Python provides basic datastructures like dictionary, list, set, and tuple. If we need another datastruct which is different from the mentioned three, we have to implement ourones.
As I started using python in my daily work, more and more questions had cropped up about the language and its refinement. One of them was to implement a custom array.
What we would like to achieve is to have a datastruct which behaves like an array.</description>

Many ways are available to handle routes, from regex to n-ary trees to parse registered route one by one.
Different ways N-ary Trees In this approach we can consider the root node as / and all children nodes as route parts are separated by /.</description>

      <description>In this post I would like to present a couple of solutions for builder pattern in python, and finally I show how I implemented a builder that I call multibuilder pattern.
Builder pattern comes in handy when we need to set a lot of fields of an object and we do not want to use many methods with multiple parameters.
All implementations are found in this repo: https://github.com/torokmark/builders_in_python
The Simple One Task: Let us implement a Person with the following fields like name, age, phone.</description>
